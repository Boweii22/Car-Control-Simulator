![78_1x_shots_so](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e004cf-cbdd-416b-bb79-28b038669828)


## Overview

This project is a **Car Control Simulation** built entirely using **native Android tools** and **Java**, without relying on external libraries or frameworks for animations. The simulation mimics basic car control functionality, featuring seamless transitions and animations that provide an engaging user experience.

## Features

- âœ¨ **Smooth Animations**: All animations are handled natively with Androidâ€™s in-built tools, resulting in smooth transitions and interactions.
- ðŸŽ® **Interactive UI**: Intuitive user interface that allows for user interaction and feedback

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Android SDK
- **Development Tools**: Android Studio
- **Animations**: Built using native Android APIs like `ObjectAnimator`, `ViewPropertyAnimator`, and `AnimatorSet`.

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/car-control-simulation-android-java.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.


## Development Process

I originally came across this idea after watching a video on YouTube and decided to implement it as a practice project. The most rewarding part of the project was working through the complexities of using native Android tools to achieve polished animations without external packages.

Some challenges I faced during development:
- Optimizing the performance of animations for smoother transitions.
- Ensuring compatibility across a wide range of Android devices and screen sizes.
